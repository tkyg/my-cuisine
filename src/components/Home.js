      <p>MyCuisine is for you to share that knowledge with others, because you are the ambassador. You know how the cuisine is supposed to taste, and you know which restaurant in your neighborhood, borough, or city serves it best.</p>
      <p>So, promote your cuisine, and in doing so promote the restaurant, and your neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Through food, give them a taste of who you are!</p>
