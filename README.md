## Description
New York City, arguably the greatest city in the world, and what makes it a metropolis is the neighborhood and the people that live in. Each proudly representing cultures from different corners of the world. One prominent representation of this myriad culture that exists here is the cuisine found in the neighborhoods, no wonder there are over 25,000 restaurants in this city. Each not only representing the people that live in the neighborhood, but also feeding them the cuisine that represents them. 

This is why [MyCuisine](https://my-cuisine-neighborhood.herokuapp.com) was built, to help foodies explore different cuisines, and find the best restaurant that serves the cuisine. And there is no one better to assist these epicures than you, the connoisseur of your cuisine. You know how the cuisine is supposed to taste, and you know which restaurant in your neighborhood, borough, or city serves it best. 

So, navigate into Add New Restaurant, and promote the restaurant that serve your cuisine the best. Click on the like button if you find your favorite restaurant already posted. For those who want to explore, navigate to Restaurants page and look for the restaurant with the most likes, and if you know which cuisine you want to taste, search for it in, Type a cuisine nameâ€¦ bar. If you approve it, click the like button to promote it. 

Here is how easily this single page application can be used.

## Installation
1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Cd into the project and run npm install
3. Run the json-server with: npm run server
4. In a new terminal Run the React server with: npm start


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
